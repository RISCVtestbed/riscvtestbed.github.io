Co-located with <a href="https://event1.nchc.org.tw/hpcasia2025/index.html">HPC Asia 2025</a>, this workshop will run between 8:30 a.m. and noon on February 19th in Hsinchu, Taiwan

## Workshop details

The goal of this workshop is to continue building the community of RISC-V in HPC, sharing the benefits of this technology with domain scientists, tool developers, and supercomputer operators. RISC-V is an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) which enables the royalty free development of CPUs and a common software ecosystem to be shared across them. Following this community driven ISA standard, a very diverse set of CPUs have been, and continue to be, developed which are suited to a range of workloads. Whilst RISC-V has become very popular already in some fields, and in 2022 the ten billionth RISC-V core was shipped, to date it has yet to gain traction in HPC.

## Abstracts

### Scaling HPC with Andes Technology: Optimizing Performance at Every Level

**_Presenter: Jason Yung-Cheng Lin_**

As a founding and premier member of RISC-V International, Andes Technology contributes to high-performance computing (HPC) with superior out-of-order execution CPU cores and vector processors optimized for HPC workloads. Additionally, Andes offers an instruction customization environment that enables developers to accelerate performance-critical functions. AndesAIRE, the AI software stack, further enhances AI workload optimization, supporting large-scale AI/ML applications from edge devices to the cloud. This session will showcase how Andes Technologyâ€™s innovations are driving performance improvements across HPC environments.

### Investigating a multi-socket high core-count RISC-V system for HPC workload

**_Presenter: Nick Brown_**

Whilst RISC-V has become popular in fields such as embedded computing, it is yet to find mainstream success in High Performance Computing (HPC). However, the 64-core RISC-V SG2042 is a potential game changer as it provides a commodity available CPU with much higher core-count than existing technologies. In this work we benchmark the SG2042 CPU hosted in an experimental, dual-socket, system to explore the performance properties of the CPU when running a common HPC benchmark suite especially across socket. Earlier benchmarks found that, on the Milk-V Pioneer that CPU is memory bound and this work confirms, even on a different system we still see those limitations. However, such a multi-socket configuration does provide an improvement in performance which helps close the gap between common HPC deployments.

Co-located with <a href="https://www.sca-hpcasia2026.jp/index.html">HPC Asia 2026</a>, this workshop will run in Osaka, Japan.

*Location:* Osaka International Convention Center

## Workshop details

The goal of this workshop is to continue building the community of RISC-V in HPC, sharing the benefits of this technology with domain scientists, tool developers, and supercomputer operators. RISC-V is an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) which enables the royalty free development of CPUs and a common software ecosystem to be shared across them. Following this community driven ISA standard, a very diverse set of CPUs have been, and continue to be, developed which are suited to a range of workloads. Whilst RISC-V has become very popular already in some fields, and in 2022 the ten billionth RISC-V core was shipped, to date it has yet to gain traction in HPC.

## Call for papers - workshop topics

We invite submissions of high-quality, original research results and works-in-progress on RISC-V with a general connection to HPC. Topics of interest for this workshop include (but are not limited to):

* Example use-cases and case-studies that use RISC-V
* Lessons learnt from leveraging RISC-V in HPC
* Industry papers exploring the use of RISC-V
* The porting of codes to RISC-V
* Novel hardware and accelerators built upon RISC-V
* Tools and techniques to aid in the use of RISC-V for HPC
* Developments in HPC libraries to port them to RISC-V
* Enhancements to RISC-V to make the architecture more suited for HPC
* Compiler and runtime support for RISC-V
* The RISC-V ecosystem
* Future gazing how RISC-V might evolve the HPC community
* And anything else related to RISC-V and HPC!

### Paper submission
We invite authors to submit original, unpublished work for consideration. Accepted papers will be included in the SCA/HPCAsia proceedings. Submissions must be in PDF format and should not exceed 12 pages, including figures and references. Manuscripts must adhere to the ACM Proceedings Style and be submitted via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=riscvhpc26">EasyChair Online Submission System</a>.

All papers should be prepared in a single-column layout and follow the official ACM formatting guidelines. Templates and detailed instructions for submission can be found at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions</a>.

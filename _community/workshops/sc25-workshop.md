## Workshop details
<img align="right" src="https://riscv.epcc.ed.ac.uk/images/sc25_black_hor_flat.png" width=350>

Co-located with SC25, this is half day workshop is running in St. Louis, USA and will be on the morning of Monday 17th of November 9:00am to 12:30pm in room 242.

The goal of this workshop is to continue building the community of RISC-V in HPC, sharing the benefits of this technology with domain scientists, tool developers, and supercomputer operators. RISC-V is an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) which enables the royalty free development of CPUs and a common software ecosystem to be shared across them. Following this community driven ISA standard, a very diverse set of CPUs and accelerators have been, and continue to be, developed which are suited to a range of workloads. Whilst RISC-V has become very popular already in some fields, and over sixteen billion RISC-V core have been shipped, to date it has yet to gain traction in HPC. However, there are numerous potential advantages that RISC-V can provide to HPC and, assuming the significant rate of growth of this technology to date continues, as we progress further into the decade it is highly likely that RISC-V will become more relevant and widespread for HPC workloads. Furthermore, recent advances in RISC-V make it a more realistic proposition for HPC workloads than ever before, and an example of this is the new commodity available hardware that we are seeing be released and made generally available.

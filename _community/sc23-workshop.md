## Workshop details
<img align="right" src="/images/sc23_hor_blackcolor@4x.png" width=350>
Co-located with SC 2023, this is a half day afternoon workshop is on Monday 13th November 2023 between 2pm and 5:3pm in room 507 of the Denver Convention Centre, USA

The goal of this workshop is to continue building the community of RISC-V in HPC, sharing the benefits of this technology with domain scientists, tool developers, and supercomputer operators. There are numerous potential advantages that RISC-V can provide to HPC and, assuming the significant rate of growth of this technology to date continues, as we progress further into the decade it is highly likely that RISC-V will become more relevant and widespread for HPC workloads. This workshop aims to bring together those already looking to popularise RISC-V in the field of HPC with the supercomputing community at-large. Sharing benefits of the architecture, success stories, and techniques we hope to further popularise the technology and increase involvement by the community in this exciting technology.

## Overview
This testbed provides HPC code developers and data-scientists with access to the latest
physical and soft-core RISC-V cores running on data centre Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to 
experiment with exploiting this hardware for testing their codes. 
RISC-V based accelerators are now gaining traction in HPC, however access to
RISC-V systems for development and testing is limited. As yet, there are few
physical RISC-V boards available and the configuration of RISC-V softcores
on FPGAs can be challenging. The RISC-V testbed profides a *turnkey*
environment for researchers to develop and test their HPC and data science
codes.

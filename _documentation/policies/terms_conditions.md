In addition to these policies, access to the RISC-V testbed is also subject to abiding by the University of Edinburgh Computing Regulations and Security Policy:
- [University of Edinburgh Computing Regulations](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/computing-regulations)
- [University of Edinburgh Security Policy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/security-policies/security-policy)

For auditing purposes we are only able to grant access to users who use their institution based email address rather than a personal one.

## You agree
- only to use the service for the purposes for which you were given access when you contacted us. If this has changed and you wish to use for a different purpose, then you must let us know via emailing [riscv-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk](riscv-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk)
- not to disrupt the working of the testbed, for example by knowingly introducing malicious software into it, nor to try to breach its security or use resources which aren’t assigned to you
- not to interfere with other users’ work, corrupt their data or invade their privacy
- not to infringe copyright or other intellectual property rights
- not to take data from any database or dataset without the explicit or implied permission of its owner
- not to use another person’s account, nor to let other people use your accounts, except by explicit agreement with us
- to keep your SAFE and machine passwords confidential, and to inform us if someone else learns any of them or if you become aware that the security of our systems is compromised in any way
- not to misuse the testbed, for example by sending spam or malicious software, by pretending to be someone else or by doing anything that might hinder or prevent someone else from using the testbed legitimately
- not to use the service for illegal or immoral purposes, such as theft, fraud, drug-trafficking, money-laundering, terrorism, pornography, violence, cruelty, incitement to racial hatred, prostitution, paedophilia, or for offensive, obscene, abusive, menacing, defamatory or insulting behaviour
- to observe the [JANET Acceptable Use Policy](https://community.ja.net/library/acceptable-use-policy)
- to comply with any special conditions that may apply to particular software packages
- you will not use the testbed for any form of blockchain mining activities

## We agree (Service Level Agreements)
- as far as we reasonably can, to provide a 24 hour service, it being understood that there will be times when the service is unavailable, for example as a result of unexpected failures, maintenance work or upgrades
- to protect the security and privacy of the data we hold about you in SAFE, as described in our [Personal Data and Privacy Policy](https://riscv.epcc.ed.ac.uk/documentation/policies/privacy/)
- that we will acquire no intellectual property rights over your software and data
- to, the best of our efforts, to respond within 24 hours to any requests for access, questions, complaints or suggestions you make about the service
- to advise on the availability of software, although we do not guarantee that we will install software for users

### We will periodically report
- The number of registered testbed users
- The number of jobs that have been run through the queue
- Total disk space usage
- Total uptime across compute nodes and login node

## You accept
- that the service is provided “as is” and we can’t guarantee 100% perfection. In legal terms, this means that we are excluding all warranties and conditions applying to the service, including those implied by law. We are not liable if things go wrong and you suffer damage as a result, although if our negligence results in anyone’s death or personal injury we do not limit or exclude our liability for that.
- that the RISC-V testbed is run on a best efforts basis and there will be times when response from us will be delayed, and the level of support that we can provide is finite.
- that you are responsible for your use of any advice or information we may give you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that it’s true and useful, but we can’t guarantee this. In legal terms, this means that we expressly disclaim any and all liability for all representations, statements, conditions or warranties to that or any other effect except to the extent that such liability may not be lawfully excluded.
- that we may make changes in the service
- that we will use the personal details which you supply to us, together with records of your use of the service, as described in our Personal Data and Privacy Policy
- that we may suspend your access to the testbed if it seems to us that you are breaking these Terms and Conditions; that if it is necessary to protect the testbed or other users’ work or data, we can halt the execution of any program which you start; and that we have the right to close your accounts
- that you alone are responsible for what you do when using the service. If you break the law you alone must answer for it, and if you cause damage to anyone else, you alone are liable, not us
- that you will acquire no intellectual property rights over the software or any information we provide
- that we may make reasonable changes to these Terms and Conditions at any time, and, once we have posted those changes on our website, the new version will then apply to you
  
These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of England and the English courts.

If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, please mail [riscv-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk](riscv-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk)

This board contains StarFiveâ€™s JH7100 SoC which is equipped with a U74 64-bit high-performance RISC-V dual-core processor with 2MB L2 cache, running at 1.5GHz. The JH7100 SoC also contains a deep learning processing engine and image/video processing sub-system which are available for use by codes. The board contains 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and gigabit ethernet.

The testbed contains two of these boards.

# FPGA hosted soft-cores

Our soft-cores currently run on an ADM-PA101 which is a Versal Prime equipped with 16GB DDR. At the time of writing this is driven via the host using PCIe and the Mercury platform to launch executables and manage memory transfer.
